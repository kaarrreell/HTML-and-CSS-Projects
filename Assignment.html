        <h1>ZODIAC:</h1>

        <p>
            The Zodiac is an ancient symbolic system created from observing the Sun’s journey across twelve distinct sections of the sky.<br>
            Each segment carries its own rhythm, character, and mythic resonance — as if the heavens were telling twelve different stories about human nature and the cycles of life.<br><br>

            Across cultures of the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and Asia, the Zodiac served as a celestial map, helping people understand the relationship between cosmic patterns and earthly experience.<br>
            Today, it remains one of the most recognizable foundations of astrology, blending tradition, symbolism, and a touch of mystery.<br><br>

            Each zodiac sign represents a unique archetype — a set of traits, impulses, and ways of interacting with the world.<br>
            Together, the twelve signs form a complete circle that reflects the diversity of human personalities and the shifting energies of the natural world.
